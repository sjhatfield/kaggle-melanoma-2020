# kaggle-melanoma-2020
This repo contains my work for the [SIIM-ISIC Melanoma Classification 2020 Kaggle contest](https://www.kaggle.com/c/siim-isic-melanoma-classification/overview)

I have written a series of post detailing my approach to the problem which can be found on my [blog](https://sjhatfield.github.io/).

Alternatively, you can look at the notebooks in this order:
* [Retrieving the data](https://github.com/sjhatfield/kaggle-melanoma-2020/blob/master/src/data/make_data.ipynb)
* [Exploring the dataset](https://github.com/sjhatfield/kaggle-melanoma-2020/blob/master/notebooks/exploration.ipynb)
* [Training a model just on patient metadata](https://github.com/sjhatfield/kaggle-melanoma-2020/blob/master/notebooks/tabular.ipynb)
* Testing some neural networks locally: [Alexnet](https://github.com/sjhatfield/kaggle-melanoma-2020/blob/master/notebooks/alexnet_internal.ipynb), [Resnet](https://github.com/sjhatfield/kaggle-melanoma-2020/blob/master/notebooks/resnet_internal.ipynb), [Efficientnet](https://github.com/sjhatfield/kaggle-melanoma-2020/blob/master/notebooks/efficientnet_testing.ipynb)
* Efficientnet on a much more powerful remote machine # TODO LINK
* [Ensembling the efficientnet and tabular models](https://github.com/sjhatfield/kaggle-melanoma-2020/blob/master/notebooks/ensemble.ipynb)
